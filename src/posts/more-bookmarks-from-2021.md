I'm not gonna lie - I'm quite disappointed in myself that I still haven't got my poop together and go back to doing this monthly. I managed to write some blog posts since March but all those happened because I milked really hard the surge of energy I had at that moment. 

As I've gone a bit quieter, the following quote has been haunting me every time I sign in on Twitter.

> On the platform, silence isn’t an option, at least not if you want the network to remember you exist.

Quote via [The internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on Instagram](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/).
