Slowly catching up on my RSS feed and I just read [Dave's post “Why would anybody start a website?”](https://daverupert.com/2025/09/why-would-anybody-start-a-website/). Obviously, Dave's post is right up my street but it reminded me of a random notes post on my phone that I wrote a while back.

Why build a website?

Why knit a jumper with your bare hands?

Why cook a homemade meal from scratch? 

Why paint in a canvas?

Why fix a broken thing?

Why write a letter?

Why anything really?

We, humans, are driven to touch and craft with our body. Deep down we crave that. Website making is a digital craft.

There, I let out a draft from my phone and it is now in my blog. Why not?

Anyway, I love how the "no thought is original" is real. Turns out, one day before I started this draft on my blog, [Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/why-make-a-website-in-2025/) also did a similar comparison. They're smarter than me, listen to them!
