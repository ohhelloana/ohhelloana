The [State of CSS Survey](https://2025.stateofcss.com/en-US) results recently came out and I was asked what I was my pick of the year in the CSS world and turns out I had an opinion. 

I told [Sacha](https://sachagreif.com/),

> My pick of the year is all the font clamp generators that people have been creating and sharing. What’s great about them is that they are all so different so it accommodates different learning styles. Especially, if reading documentation alone doesn’t help understanding how something works.

For example, [Modern fluid typography editor](https://modern-fluid-typography.vercel.app/) and [Clamp Generator](https://clamp-generator.netlify.app/). There's plenty more out there but I've picked these two as they have different designs and UI and that shows different approaches to the same concept. My favourite thing about it is that one of them may work for someone else’s particular way of thinking and learning. I'm always fascinated by how people approach the build of a CSS generator and how they interpret the documentation. 

I have a little bit more room here to expand on my pick of the year: my pick is you - the author and creator of different ways to explain the same existing concept. Like Andy sharing [more ways to centre a div](https://piccalil.li/blog/another-article-about-centering-in-css/) or Josh [explaining SVGs](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/svg/friendly-introduction-to-svg/) because explaining something with your own voice will always be an unique experience for the reader.

I'd encourage everyone to write one guide on something that isn't new and fancy.

Meanwhile, I'll save the screenshot of my contribution into my "happy" folder. Ana from 2018 and before would be delighted.
