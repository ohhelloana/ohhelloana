Exactly two months I shared that I was about to do a little "summer tour" of my a talk about refactoring CSS. And I did! I spoke at [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl/), [Middlesbrough Front End](https://www.middlesbroughfe.co.uk/) and [Pixel Pioneers](https://pixelpioneers.co/) in three weeks and it was scary and wonderful, very similar to [Brecht's experience](https://utilitybend.com/blog/css-day-2025-a-little-story-by-a-little-man-on-quite-a-big-stage)! 

I had great conversations with people afterwards and I'm super happy that my talk inspired Bart from [Project Wallace](https://www.projectwallace.com/) to [add spacing resets to the tool](https://github.com/projectwallace/css-analyzer/pull/467#event-18141390439).

On the other hand, I am gutted that [Middlesbrough Front End](https://www.middlesbroughfe.co.uk/) [will not return next year](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/middlesbrough-front-end_goodbye-after-six-incredible-years-we-activity-7345741888592769024-5VID). This has been an incredibly difficult time for conference organisers and I am heartbroken that the team doesn't have the support to continue. I am so lucky to have been a part of the last event. 

I am now preparing for the next run of this talk at [SmashingConf Freiburg](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2025/). You can still buy tickets ([this link includes a sweet discount](https://ti.to/smashingmagazine/smashingconf-freiburg-2025/discount/IHopeYouWillBeJoiningMe))! Later in November I will also be speaking at [beyond tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2025/speakers) which I am over the moon for.

I'm so happy to have had these experiences. Thank you so much to the organisers for having faith in me and every single person who came to say something nice after my talks. And, of course, thank you to my husband, Hactar folks, [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/) alongside Clearleft friends, [Jake](https://jakearchibald.com/) and [Paul](https://paulcuth.me.uk/) for listening to the practise runs of my talk and giving me invaluable feedback. 

Did you see my talk anywhere and have feedback? Please share in the form after this post or via email. I'm always keen to improve and learn.
