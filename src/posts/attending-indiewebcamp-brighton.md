I am excited to attend IndieWebCamp Brighton in less than a month! I already booked my non-refundable hotel, which felt very nerve-wracking! 

The last time I tried to attend an IndieWebCamp, I ended up cancelling my trip last minute because childcare plans fell through.

But Brighton is near where I live, so hopefully, all will go well this time.
I'm super looking forward to meeting people from the community and having some dedicated time to work on my little blog! I know that technically, this could have been an RSVP type of post, so it's one more thing for my backlog of things to improve around here.

I'm really thankful to [Paul Robert Lloyd](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/) for taking the initiative to organise this. If you need any more convincing, [Paul has written a more compelling introduction to the event on his blog](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2024/032/a1/indiewebcamp_brighton/).

[Learn more about the event and RSVP on the event page](https://indieweb.org/2024/Brighton). 

See you there?
