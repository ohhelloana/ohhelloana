<p>For the last couple of weeks, I’ve been helping out <a href="https://cheuk.dev/">Cheuk</a> and <a href="https://calumryan.com/">Calum</a> organise IndieWebCamp London and all the excitement has been building up now that we’re approaching the date of the event.</p>

<p>Similar to other IndieWebCamps, we’ll start off the day with breakfast, intros and keynotes followed by planning our day in a BarCamp-like environment.</p>

<p>Everyone is encouraged to bring up topics and participate in the discussions. With a barcamp on day one, we’ll have the second day to build things. At the time of writing, there will be a keynote from Kevin Feeney and the schedule for the weekend is available on the <a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/london">event page</a>.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog/indie-web-camp-berlin-2018">my first IndieWebCamp</a> in 2018 and I’m pretty stoked to be contributing to a community that means a lot to me. I’m really hoping that at least someone goes home feeling excited about building things for themselves, similar to how I felt.</p>

<p>So, do you have a personal website to work on? Or do you want to start one? There’s still time to <a href="https://2020.indieweb.org/london">register</a> and join us on the 14th of March. </p>
