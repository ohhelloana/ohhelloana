description: It's been eight years since we adopted Jessie and I should have posted about it!

I am currently regretting the posts I didn't make. Yes, as someone who bangs on and on about posting things on your blog first and then elsewhere, I too fail many times. And, it's been like that when it comes to Jessie. 

Since we adopted Jessie in 2017, I've been celebrating her adoption aniversary on social media instead of this blog. And it bit me in the arse. I used to have a lovely thread going on for years on Twitter but, of course, I haven't touched that hell space in a very long time. I was lazy and now I am paying the price. For this year's anniversary I still posted on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ohhelloana.blog/post/3lw5ds3y2zc2y) and [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@anarodrigues/115011366161406914) but, I want to make sure that memory is captured here too. 

Sweet Jessie has been with us for eight years now and, fun fact, she is about to turn 14! She was five years old when we adopted her. It's been a priviledge that the majority of her life has now been with us.

Since living with us she has:
* lived in three different homes;
* brought a mouse in only once (and it was a baby so it doesn't count);
* went missing once (the worst);
* has had dentist appointments and teeth removed; 
* became a big sister to an human;

I really hope I have many more years of posts to make. ðŸ’—
