I want to read all the newsletters I subscribed to. 

I want to read everything in the ten web dev community slacks I joined. 

I want to read everything on the seven Discord servers I am on. 

I want to read every blog post in the hundreds of feeds I follow. 

I want to read every toot of the people I follow on Mastodon. 

I want to find more people to follow. 

I want to ensure I didn’t miss your cool and happy announcement. 

I want to attend your conference/meet-up virtually.

I want to watch your livestream and support you.

I want to view the videos in the archive of this conference that I missed in person.

I want to listen to that audiobook that I’ve had for months.

I want to listen to your podcast.

But I need to work and live life outside of consumption and entertainment. 

And then worry that I am behind.

Then, I worry that I must apply the latest knowledge and wisdom, but I probably have missed it.

And worry that pals could think that I ignored them.

I want it all, but it is impossible.
