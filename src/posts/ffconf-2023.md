Two weeks ago, I spoke at [FFConf](https://2023.ffconf.org/). Yes! Me! Last year, I made a little shy appearance in one of [Sophie's](https://localghost.dev/) slides, but it was the big deal this year.

[I mentioned in a toot](https://mastodon.social/@ohhelloana/111171359089249081) a while back how special FFConf is for me. Years ago, my friend [Paul](https://paulcuth.me.uk/) told me about it, and it turned out to be a life-changing conference. 

I was disheartened with the industry and tech community at the time (I think this was in 2016). The talks I saw and the people I met throughout the years were the inspiration and acceptance I desperately needed to find.

I even found my current job by chatting with people there. Someone told me about this agency, and I should say "hi". I did, and it turns out they were hiring! 

As you can imagine, I was over the moon that I was invited to speak there after applying to their call for papers. 

The topic was the same as [The State of the Browser](https://2023.stateofthebrowser.com/), but I changed the slides and demo based on feedback received and my own perception after watching the video. I also added a new demo at the end! 

One of my last slides was a thank you to one of the talks from the previous years that really moved me at the time. In 2018, [Tim Holman's](https://tholman.com/) talk showed us some enjoyable demos. Then he compiled what he learned from building some seemingly "useless things". He ends with "any idea you have has value". So there I was, on a stage, sharing what I learned from building a karaoke in the browser. 

Unlike the previous years at FFConf, I was extremely nervous this year. My head was over the place during the day. I was the penultimate speaker, so I could relax and enjoy Salma's talk. 

Now, I plan to watch all the videos of the other talks when they come out so that I can properly enjoy them. 

[Trys Mudford](https://www.trysmudford.com/) took [photos of the day](https://www.flickr.com/photos/remysharp/albums/72177720312654713) and wrote a lovely recap. So did [Amy](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/ffconf-2023/) and [Remy](https://remysharp.com/2023/11/15/my-experience-of-ffconf-2023)! 

This has been one of the highlights of my (quite crappy) year. I hope I contributed to people feeling as happy at the end of the day as I felt all these years as an attendee. Thank you to everyone who came to say hi before and after the talk! My heart is full!
