I'm over the moon to share that I am one of the speakers for this year's [WebExpo](https://webexpo.net/sessions/exploring-the-potential-of-the-web-speech-api-in-karaoke/)! It will be my first time attending WebExpo. I was impressed with how keen the organising team was on the community and the attendees' experience.

It will also be my first time at a multi-track conference, and the speakers list is so good! I know it will be difficult for me to choose what to attend.

Since I gave this talk at the State of the Browser and FFConf, I've been working on new experiments and sharing the things I've learned.

Tickets are still available; you should get them before they increase the price!

See you there?
