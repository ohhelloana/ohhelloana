I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for community-led events in the front-end community, and I am forever grateful for that. However, I am heartbroken by the current state of the events. 

Many community-led events have recently been cancelled due to low ticket sales, which feeds a gigantic gap of events left by the pandemic. I remember [we had to cancel the in-person London CSS and IndieWebCamp London](https://ohhelloana.blog/one-year-of-online-only/) at the very last minute back in 2020, and it was incredibly stressful to disappoint attendees and speakers. 

It is obvious that in-person events have either not returned or are maybe a little less frequent than before the pandemic. But that was a public health event—having to cancel events due to financial strain sounds incredibly painful, and I know it is the current stress of many event organisers.

When I moved to the UK in 2015, I struggled a lot. I was already struggling with feeling too much of a junior developer. I felt alone and missed my friends. I also thought that the front-end community was my co-workers who happened to be bullies and whatever the Twitter timeline showed me. I hated myself and this career, but I genuinely had absolutely no other skill that could match the salary I desperately needed. 

My friend Paul joined the company I was working at and recommended events for me to attend. Nearly 10 years later, Paul and I still attend conferences together. At the time, he raved about [FFConf](https://ffconf.org/). I got a ticket, and [my life changed](https://ohhelloana.blog/ffconf-2023/). 

I couldn't believe it - there were actually conferences and meet-ups that encouraged you as you are and welcomed you even with all your lack of knowledge. At the time, I always thought I didn't belong at any meet-up or conference. The few I had attended so far always made me feel less than. But for the first time ever, I… had a great time. The following year, we attended [All Day Hey!](https://heypresents.com/) and then [State of the Browser](stateofthebrowser.com). By 2018, I was incredibly motivated and engaged in the front-end community, and I had organised my own events, such as Codebar Monthlies, Homebrew Website Clubs, and LondonCSS.

I have so many feel-good memories of events and talks I saw.

[Jeremy's talk at ViewSource](https://viewsourceconf.org/london-2017/speakers/jeremy-keith/) that made me work on this blog. 

I remember [Jo](https://github.com/thisisjofrank)'s talk about perfectionism, Impostor Syndrome and Anxiety. It was the quick therapy lesson I didn't know I needed then. All because of a community-led event called TODO London. 

[Charlie's talk at FFConf](https://ffconf.org/talks/dear-developer/), which mentioned "CV-driven development", explained my frustration with modern front-end tools. 

[Tim's talk](https://ffconf.org/talks/weird-web/) unlocked something in me: you can learn by building useless things. 

I cried during [Suz's talk](https://ffconf.org/talks/nerdverse/). I, too, have that passion. 

Beaming with a smile because all I want is to be as cool as [Ruth](https://ffconf.org/talks/2022_rumyra_talk/).

Feeling avenged by [Heydon's talks](https://ffconf.org/talks/2022_heydonworks_talk/).

Dreaming to be as bright as [Michelle](https://2022.stateofthebrowser.com/speaker/michelle-barker/).

Karaoke parties after events. 

Conversations with people and realising that I was finally surrounded by people who cared about making a usable web. 

Seeing my "buddies from the internet" at least once a year.

Meeting my "buddies from the internet" for the first time when we attend the same event. 

And many more...

It is 2024, and I am so grateful to have given talks at the events that inspired me. But I am also grieving the loss of other events I deeply loved, like TODO London, and recently having conferences like [Front](https://frontconference.com/) be cancelled. Every little meet-up in London and conference contributed to who I am as a person and a professional.

I agree with [Marc](https://marcthiele.com/notes/state-of-events-2024): the things I said above can happen at corporate events. But damn… small community-driven events are that little 3rd space for someone like me… who made their hobby their career and now doesn't know where to hang out. 

I love you all and miss you. 

This said, I have some news: I'm going to start a [new small free meet-up in south west London](https://swlondon.codes/). Hopefully, this will attract people who live in the area and work from home. I hope to share more news soon.
