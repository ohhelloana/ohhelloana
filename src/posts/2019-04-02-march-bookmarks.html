<p>This “bookmarking” format doesn’t seem to be working for me because of the way I am doing this. It also seems that I am bookmarking more and more things and I leave all the bookmarks to the last days of the month. I feel like I don’t have enough time to give them proper treatment. I want to share my favourite quotes and my opinions on them and this method seems rushed. I might go back to my original plan of doing them every two weeks.</p>
<p>I have also decided to split between tech and non-tech related articles because I feel that the amount should be the same (and it currently isn’t).</p>
<p>Also this month went by too quickly. Too quickly.</p>
