Some weeks ago [Oliver from Pixel Pioneers asked](https://pixelpioneers.co/blog/speaker-spotlight-ana-rodrigues) me: "How did you come up with the idea for your upcoming Pixel Pioneers talk, and what can we expect to take away from it?". This is my answer:

> Around two years ago I realised that I was feeling a lot of decision paralysis when building brand new shiny projects from scratch. I was feeling very overwhelmed with all the new cool CSS things, and I would panic a little bit wondering if I was building and styling something up to the best and ultimate standards. This isn’t particularly healthy. I noticed a pattern of feeling safe and relaxed when I worked on legacy codebases. Someone made a decision years ago on something and I could work on it and note the impact. CSS is fantastic at failing, and modernising an old codebase can be particularly exciting. But because CSS is undervalued and it “just works”, it can be difficult to convince stakeholders to take the time to give it some love. But I’ve done it, and it does make a difference in the end Hopefully, by the end of the talk, people will feel confident to approach an old codebase without immediately deciding to rebuild.

I've been doing some test runs this week with work and friends and I am finally feeling excited and not just nervous. 

The first big public run of it will be at [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl/) this week and it is sold out! (But there's still tickets for the live stream). The following weeks will be at [Middlesbrough Front End](https://www.middlesbroughfe.co.uk/) and [Pixel Pioneers](https://pixelpioneers.co/). Both in the UK and with tickets still available.

Then, later this year, I will also be at [SmashingConf Freiburg](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2025/)! 

Let me know you if you're attending any of these and please do come say hi!
