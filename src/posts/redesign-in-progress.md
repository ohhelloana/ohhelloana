I announced on twitter a couple of days ago that I went a bit rogue on my blog. I removed all the CSS after converting it from Jekyll to Eleventy and I want a brand new design for it. The trouble is I'm not a designer. 

It doesn't help that I have an irrational hate for white backgrounds. I was just now looking up on Pinterest for some inspiration when I realised that I wasn't looking at "blog designs". I was looking at notebooks. When I want to think about my blog, I look at everything but web design. In fact, [my previous blog design](https://twitter.com/ohhelloana/status/1201577627456331776/photo/1), was inspired by a [scrapbook pin](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/159385274297948765/). This tiny fact was actually buried in my memory because only just now I re-visited my saved pins.

There are rare moments where I see something, like a [painting](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437383) or a concert and my immediately think: "how can I make my blog look like that?" and it isn't even... a *web medium* thing!

I've added a tiny bar at the top of the website to let people know that this is a very raw redesign and it might take a while. I'm sure my blog looks much better in an RSS reader. I've also reduced the size of the main image so that a cat bum isn't the first thing people see.

I'm still working out how it will look like. And then I will make it super IndieWeb! Until there, I will vent in my workplace slack channel about how much all I want is a pretty blog.
