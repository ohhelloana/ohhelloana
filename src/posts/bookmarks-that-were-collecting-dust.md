description: Some things I had saved since June this year until now. Lots more were missed.
hasMood: true
mood: Blue
doing: Waiting for dinner
thinking: This year I'm feeling really demotivated to share my bookmarks. I
  haven't been up to date with "the latest" from tech so I allowed this fun
  thing I used to do to be my own measurement of productivity and that isn't ok.
listening: Nothing

Here are some of the things that have been collecting dust in my bookmarks since June. I missed a lot of things shared online since. I hope one day I can catch up. This really isn't my year when it comes to sharing bookmarks. Luckily, the world won't end because of it!
