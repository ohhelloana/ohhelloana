I'm excited to share that I am one of the speakers for this year's [All Day Hey](https://heypresents.com/conferences/2024)! I first attended All Day Hey in 2018, and it has since been one of my favourite conferences. Well, technically, this is a comeback to the stage since I did give a lightning talk at All Day Hey back in 2019.  

So, five years later (I can't believe it has been five years), I will be back, but this time to talk in a longer format about my new experiments with the Web Speech API and thinking a bit more about voice interfaces. 

I've been working on new experiments and will be sharing new things I've learnt since I gave this talk at the State of the Browser and FFConf. 

Tickets are still available but I bet not for long! 

See you there?
