        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

        <p>I care about privacy and hope the following explains everything the website does. Contact me if you have any questions.</p>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently using <a href="https://withcabin.com/">Cabin</a> for my analytics. It is a privacy-first, carbon-conscious web analytics service. The only information I can see is the number of hits, top pages visited, referrals, bounce rate, countries, languages, devices, desktop and screen size, browsers, OS, and attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every once in a while, I remove analytics entirely, but my main goal is to use the referrals to discover other websites.
        </p>

        <h3>Third party resources</h3>

        <p>For posts involving code, I use <a href="https://prismjs.com/">PrismJs</a>, a syntax highlighter.
            I also use <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> to receive webmentions. Although I do not display them in articles for now, I show them in my guestbook. Contact me if you'd like your web mentions deleted.</p>

        <h3>Form submissions</h3>

        <p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/gdpr-ccpa/">Netlify</a> handles form submissions. The content of these forms is only read by me and stays stored in Netlify's dashboard. I do not have access to any other info besides the content of the form, nor can I match it with the analytics from Cabin. I also do not share the content of the form submissions. I may use the email provided in the form to reply to the author of the form submission.</p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are not used for functional or tracking purposes, and I do not use third-party cookies.</p>
