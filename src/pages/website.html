<h2>Website credits and thank yous</h2>

<p>This website is hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, somehow for free.</p>

<p>The "tape" effect and drawn border were found in this super neat <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/dyydRqJ">codepen</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/meowlivia_">Olivia Ng</a>. And I wish I could say that I also did the notebook css pattern from scratch but I didn't. I found it on this cool <a href="https://codepen.io/InnerGraffiks/pen/grxXkA">codepen</a> too by Fabien.</p>

<p>I drew my current header on a post-it and <a href="https://tayo.co.za/">Tayo</a>, the coolest, traced it for me. I now am the proud owner of an Ipad so I will never have to bother her again for this. </p>

<p>In the past this blog was a self hosted Wordpress blog and later converted to Jekyll. As of 2020 it is using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and because I had no idea what I was doing a few times, I looked up <a href="https://hylia.website/">Hylia</a> a lot. 

<p>You can visit this blog's work in progress in the <a href="https://github.com/ohhelloana/ohhelloana/projects">projects section</a> of the repo. This is a constant work in progress.</p>

<h2>What is this section for?</h2>

<p>This page is also a work in progress - but I am planning to capture here all the decisions I make regarding this website. Come back soon!</p>
