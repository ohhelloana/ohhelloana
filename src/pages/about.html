      <p>I was born in Portugal until my adulthood. I started developing for the web over 10 years ago, as a hobby, because I wanted to create fan sites about my favourite music artists.</p>

      <p>When I turned 17 I realised I had no other skills in life other than creating websites but I was still a very curious person and tried to be creative all the time. </p>

      <p>With that in mind I decided to study design, photography and video in university and have a bachelor's degree in multimedia. By the end of my studies I realised that I wanted to work in web development. I've been working as a front end developer since the end of 2012.</p>

      <p>As much as I love what I do, I am also interested in other topics. So if you bump into me at events feel free to chat to me about: ethics, IndieWeb, sustainability, plants, cooking, privacy, cats, memes, DIY, films, travel, dreams and skin care.</p>

      <p>I currently live in London with my husband and my cat.</p>

    <h3>How to pronounce Rodrigues?</h3>

    <p>I'm okay with people using a Spanish pronunciation but in reality it sounds more like <i>roo-dree-guhsh</i>.</p>
