<h2>Oh hello! I'm Ana!</h2>

<img class="about-page-photo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/profile/ana.jpg" alt="Photo of Ana"></img>

<p>I was born in Portugal and lived there until 2015. I started developing for the web over 10 years ago, as a hobby, because I wanted to create fan sites about my favourite music artists.</p>

<p>When I turned 17 I realised I had no other skills in life other than creating websites but I was still a very curious person and tried to be creative all the time. </p>

<p>With that in mind I decided to study design, photography and video in university and have a bachelor's degree in multimedia. By the end of my studies I realised that I wanted to work in web development. I've been working as a front end developer since the end of 2012.</p>

<p>As much as I love what I do, I am also interested in other topics. So if you bump into me at events feel free to chat to me about: ethics, IndieWeb, sustainability, plants, cooking, privacy, cats, memes, DIY, films, travel, dreams and skin care.</p>

<p>I currently live in London with my husband and my cat.</p>

<h2>Website credits and thank yous</h2>

<p>This website is hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, somehow for free.</p>

<p>The "tape" effect and drawn border were found in this super neat <a href="https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/dyydRqJ">codepen</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/meowlivia_">Olivia Ng</a>. And I wish I could say that I also did the notebook css pattern from scratch but I didn't. I found it on this cool <a href="https://codepen.io/InnerGraffiks/pen/grxXkA">codepen</a> too by Fabien.</p>

<p>I drew my current header on a post-it and <a href="https://tayo.co.za/">Tayo</a>, the coolest, traced it for me. I now am the proud owner of an Ipad so I will never have to bother her again for this. </p>

<p>In the past this blog was a self hosted Wordpress blog and later converted to Jekyll. As of 2020 it is using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> and because I had no idea what I was doing a few times, I looked up <a href="https://hylia.website/">Hylia</a> a lot. 

<p>You can visit this blog's work in progress in the <a href="https://github.com/ohhelloana/ohhelloana/projects">projects section</a> of the repo. This is a constant work in progress.</p>
