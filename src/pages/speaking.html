            <h2>Talks history and upcoming dates</h2>
            <h3>Maintaining and Modernising Legacy CSS</h3>

            <p>In recent years, updates in CSS have given us many exciting possibilities for creating modern, dynamic web experiences. Yet, for many developers, the day-to-day reality often involves working within the constraints of legacy codebases.</p>

            <p>In her talk, Ana will explore practical strategies for navigating the challenges of maintaining and modernizing legacy CSS. Is refactoring an option? What are the pros and cons of this? How do we approach stakeholders? And if refactoring is not an option, how do we prioritize and initiate changes, measure improvements and quick wins?</p>

            <p>With her many years of finding the balance here, Ana will share lessons from past experiences and look forward to what's ahead.</p>

            <h3>A talk about blogging</h3>

            <p>At the time, I changed the title of this talk depending on the event, but the jist was: a talk that would cover my experience with blogging, the communities that will support you and how to battle the self-doubt and fears that can get in the way of creating your own personal playground. These were talks about how you could write about what you want and not be afraid about not being innovative or cool.</p>
            
            <p>I converted them into a blog post called <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog/blogging-and-me/">"Blogging and Me"</a>. I gave this talk in three different formats: automatic slides every 15 seconds (20 slides meaning 5 minutes on stage), a regular lightning talk (10 minutes) and a long talk (between 20 and 30 minutes).</p>
