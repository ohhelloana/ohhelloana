            <h3>Exploring the Potential of the Web Speech API in Karaoke</h3>

            <p>Isn't it frustrating when the song you want isn't available at karaoke? Let's see if we can solve this. We will look at the current state of the Web Speech API, see what's possible, what isn't and what we have to look forward to.</p>

            <h3>A talk about blogging</h3>

            <p>At the time, I changed the title of this talk depending on the event, but the jist was: a talk that would cover my experience with blogging, the communities that will support you and how to battle the self-doubt and fears that can get in the way of creating your own personal playground. These were talks about how you could write about what you want and not be afraid about not being innovative or cool.</p>
            
            <p>I converted them into a blog post called <a href="https://ohhelloana.blog/blogging-and-me/">"Blogging and Me"</a>. I gave this talk in three different formats: automatic slides every 15 seconds (20 slides meaning 5 minutes on stage), a regular lightning talk (10 minutes) and a long talk (between 20 and 30 minutes).</p>
